## Reflections

**1. Getting Started with TypeScript /** Learned why TypeScript excels over JavaScript for web development, how to install and set it up.

**2. Declare Variable Types in TypeScript /** Learned to declare variables using primitive types, object types, and union and intersection types.

**3. Implement Interfaces in TypeScript /** Learned the reasons for using interfaces in TypeScript. Also learned how to declare, create, and extend them.

**4. Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript /** Learned why to use strict typing for functions. Experimented with functions with required, optional, default parameters, and rest parameters. Understood how to use function whith type aliases and interfaces.

**5. Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript /** Learned Object-Oriented Programming in TypeScript, how to declare classes, fields, methods. How to specify modifiers and static properties of a class. Learned about inheritance and working with interfaces in classes.

**6. Generics in TypeScript /** Explored how to use generics, creating arrays, functions, classes, and their constraints in advance without defining them types  beforehand.

**7. Work with External Libraries in TypeScript /** Learned how to work with modules in TS, import libraries, and find their adaptation for TS.

**8. Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript /** Explored an alternative to modules - namespaces, how to encapsulate code using them in single and multiple files.
