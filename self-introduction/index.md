### About Me
My name is Vlad and I'm a junior Front-end developer. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the National Technical University "Dnipro Polytechnic" and a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Customs and Finance, both with honors. Additionally, I completed front-end developer courses within the international educational system ORT.

Programming attracts me due to opportunity to solve logical tasks using my knowledge. For me, it's akin to chess, where I seek solutions to specific situations to gain maximum advantage. In programming, I also value finding the most effective solutions. Sometimes, I delve too deeply into optimization or attempt to solve an interesting problem independently, disregarding existing solutions, which can lead to issues. Therefore, I strive to maintain a balance, avoiding excessive optimization and maintaining code readability, and not ignoring already existing optimal solutions. I have learned from experience in this regard.

I chose the JavaScript programming language because it allows creating both FrontEnd and BackEnd, and I wanted to understand both aspects for full comprehension of website development. I made the final decision in favor of this language due to its growing cross-platform potentials with Node.js and technologies as TypeScript. So, I see significant potential in JavaScript, which makes me proud to develop with it.

Programming, for me, is an opportunity to do something useful for society while engaging in problem-solving, which brings me happiness and satisfaction.

I would like to show you some of my projects.

### CryWEB

This is my master's thesis dedicated to improving end-to-end encryption for web messaging systems and developing a web application demonstrating its functionality. The main idea is to improve encryption of each individual message, solving the issue of session encryption and user static encryption. This helps to deprive an attacker of an advantage when intercepting session messages and decrypting individual messages. Such an approach is more effective than increasing key size.
Additionally, optimization of these processes for the server was carried out, relieving it from the task of encrypting and decrypting large data by moving these processes to client side.

Here is a block diagram of the "sender-server" algorithm, as well as the "server-receiver".

Node.js with the Express library was chosen for implementing the server-side of this project. 
MongoDB, a non-relational database, was selected as database, and the Mongoose technology was used to work with it through Node.js.

### Epam Marathon
I participated in the Epam marathon, where I developed registration form for flight to planets of the Solar System and received certificate for it.

## Coffee House
On the RSS courses, first challenge I encountered was slider with time delay. I implemented it using setTimeout() closure. On hover, I removed it and saved the time elapsed since beginning, and upon restart, I passed the remainder to new setTimeout().

## Nonograms/WebPack
For Nonograms, I used SASS and WebPack, which I had studied before the courses. Additionally, I connected Babel to transform code for older browsers.

## Resume
And finally, this is my old resume, which I want to rewrite, already with all the modern technologies. However, it still contains useful information about my education, skills, and experience.

## End
With that, I conclude this video. All links to the showcased works can be found in index.md. Goodbye!
