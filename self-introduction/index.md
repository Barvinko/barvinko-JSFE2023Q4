My name is Vlad and I'm a junior Front-end developer. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the National Technical University "Dnipro Polytechnic" and a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Customs and Finance, both with honors. Additionally, I completed front-end developer courses within the international educational system ORT.

Programming attracts me due to opportunity to solve logical tasks using my knowledge. For me, it's akin to chess, where I seek solutions to specific situations to gain maximum advantage. In programming, I also value finding the most effective solutions. Sometimes, I delve too deeply into optimization or attempt to solve an interesting problem independently, disregarding existing solutions, which can lead to issues. Therefore, I strive to maintain a balance, avoiding excessive optimization and maintaining code readability, and not ignoring already existing optimal solutions. I have learned from experience in this regard.

I chose the JavaScript programming language because it allows creating both FrontEnd and BackEnd, and I wanted to understand both aspects for full comprehension of website development. I made the final decision in favor of this language due to its growing cross-platform potentials with Node.js and technologies as TypeScript. So, I see significant potential in JavaScript, which makes me proud to develop with it.

Programming, for me, is an opportunity to do something useful for society while engaging in problem-solving, which brings me happiness and satisfaction.

I would like to show you some of my projects.
